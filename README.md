# 2024_comp_bot
 This is the code for Team 5464: Bluejacket Robotics' competition robot for Crescendo.

 We'd like to thank Andrew from team 281, The GreenVillains, for helping us get started with Swerve Drive this year!
 Without his help, we likely would have hit our head against the walls for many more days during the build season.
 
 This project is based on Entechlib from 281: https://github.com/entech281/EntechLib
